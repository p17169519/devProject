The aim of this project was to create an e-commerce website for an independent local
takeaway style business.

The online food ordering system, allows for two portals.
1. User/customer. The user will have the ability to place an order, as well as
registering an account.
2. Admin. The admin will be able to view, edit, add and remove menu items and
customer details.

The front-end is implemented using html5, CSS and JavaScript.
